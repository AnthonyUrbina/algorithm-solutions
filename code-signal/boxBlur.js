The pixels in the input image are
represented as integers. The algorithm
distorts the input image in the following way:
Every pixel x in the output image has a
value equal to the average value of the pixel
values from the 3 Ã— 3 square that has its
center at x, including x itself. All the
pixels on the border of x are then removed.

Return the blurred image as an integer, with
 the fractions rounded down.
